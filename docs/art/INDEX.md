# Art — Badge Visual System

**This section owns how badges look and how they are produced: the style rules that make 24 images read as one collectible series, the pipeline that guarantees uniform output, and the protocol that decides which render ships.**

| Doc | Answers |
|---|---|
| [style-guide.md](./style-guide.md) | What does a badge look like, and what is forbidden? |
| [production-pipeline.md](./production-pipeline.md) | How is a badge generated, checked, graded, and exported? |
| [voting-protocol.md](./voting-protocol.md) | How is the winning render chosen, by whom? |

## The short version

Painterly splash art with luminous, saturated color; one central subject with a strong silhouette; absolutely no text in the image; one declared focus mode and one canonical direction per badge; square 1024 px masters with 72 px and 32 px derivatives. Names are drawn by the card renderer, not painted.

## Asset location

Winning 32 px and 72 px derivatives ship in `assets/badges/` and are inlined into the HTML card as data URIs. Masters, prompts, losing renders, and pipeline scripts stay out of this repo. To regenerate, follow [production-pipeline.md](./production-pipeline.md) against a local scratch directory; do not add network fetches to the grading path.
