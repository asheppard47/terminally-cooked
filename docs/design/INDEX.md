# Design — Behavior Spec

**This section defines what the program does: how a session becomes a score, which achievements exist, and what the output card contains.** It is the contract the code in [engineering/](../engineering/INDEX.md) implements and the tests enforce.

| Doc | Answers |
|---|---|
| [scoring-model.md](./scoring-model.md) | How does a transcript become a number, and what does that number claim? |
| [modifier-catalog.md](./modifier-catalog.md) | Which achievements exist, what triggers each, and what is it worth? |
| [card-spec.md](./card-spec.md) | What does the output look like and which fields may appear? |
