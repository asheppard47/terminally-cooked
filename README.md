# Terminally Cooked

An AI coding session roast. Grade one of your own agent sessions into a comedy
results card, in the red/green diff-counter look. Local-only: it reads a
session file already on your disk, counts what happened, stamps named
achievements, and prints a card. The score is entertainment and says so.

Supported harnesses (auto-detected from the file's own shape): **Claude Code**,
**Codex CLI**, **Grok CLI**, **Gemini CLI**. Cross-harness scores are different
games. The card stamps which adapter produced it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asheppard47/terminally-cooked.git
cd terminally-cooked
python3 grade_session.py            # juicy session from today, never the live one
python3 grade_session.py a3a4d4fb   # session-uuid prefix
python3 grade_session.py path/to/session.jsonl
python3 grade_session.py --html     # standalone HTML card
python3 grade_session.py --share    # copy a caption; you paste it
python3 test_grade_session.py       # 38 tests
python3 grade_session.py --help
```

Python 3.9+, stdlib only. Badge PNGs live in `assets/badges/` and ride along
in the clone. HTML cards embed them as data URIs, so producing a card does not
hit the network.

Point a Codex rollout, a Grok session directory, or a Gemini chat file at the
same CLI. Clone this repo into your agent's skill path if you want the bundled
[SKILL.md](./SKILL.md) — it tells the agent how to grade, and what it may
repair when a transcript format drifts.

## Privacy

Nothing leaves the machine. There is no network code on the grading path. Card
fields are allowlisted — no prompt text, file paths, repo names, or tool output —
and a test enforces it. Sharing a card is something you do. Full contract:

## Status

Scoring v0.5, 24 modifiers, 35 tests. Known coupling: each CLI's session
format can change. Adapters fail open; breakage is a degraded card, not a
crash. See
[docs/engineering/transcript-observables.md](./docs/engineering/transcript-observables.md).
